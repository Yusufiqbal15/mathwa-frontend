## 🚨 Important Notes

### For Shared Hosting:

1. **Only upload `dist/` folder contents**
   - Don't upload src/, node_modules/, etc.
   - These are development files only

2. **Make sure `.htaccess` is uploaded**
   - This handles all routing
   - Without it, navigation won't work

3. **Wait for DNS propagation**
   - Can take 24-48 hours after domain setup
   - Accessible via IP address immediately

4. **Clear browser cache after upload**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows)
   - Or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)

5. **Check file permissions**
   - Files: 644
   - Folders: 755
   - Most hosting auto-configures this

### For API Integration:

Update these files with your backend URL:
- Search for `API_BASE` in component files
- Change from `localhost:8000` to your production API
- Test all API calls after deployment

---

## 💡 Next Steps After Upload

1. ✅ Verify website loads
2. ✅ Test all navigation links
3. ✅ Check mobile view
4. ✅ Test contact form
5. ✅ Verify images display
6. ✅ Check console for errors (F12)
7. ✅ Test donation page
8. ✅ Update API endpoints if needed
