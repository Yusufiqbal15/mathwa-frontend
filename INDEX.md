## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need Node.js to run the site on shared hosting?**
A: No! Only for development. The `dist/` folder has compiled code ready to run.

**Q: What if my host doesn't support .htaccess?**
A: Check with your hosting provider. Most support it. If not, they can help with configuration.

**Q: Can I edit the site after uploading?**
A: To make changes, edit source files → run `npm run build` → re-upload `dist/` folder.

**Q: How do I connect to the backend API?**
A: Update API endpoints in the React components from `localhost:8000` to your production URL.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: All security headers are configured. HTTPS is recommended (most hosts offer free SSL).
